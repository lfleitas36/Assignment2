# Assignment2 (Python Programming)
This assignment is a programming exercise and you will need to create file called assignment2.py and
upload it to Gradescope for grading. Each of the following tasks needs to be implemented as methods in
the class Assignment2 . You are free to implement other methods in the class and/or use secondary .py
file(s) for additional implementations. If you do so, you will need to submit them to Gradescope as well.
Note that there are strict requirements how class and methods should be named. If you fail to follow the
requirement, your work will not be graded. Each task is worth 1 point.
You don't need to implement validation of the input parameters, we will always supply legitimate values
in our testing scripts.
Make sure you implement each requested function as a class method! Unless it is explicitly asking
for a static method, you must include self as a first special argument.
